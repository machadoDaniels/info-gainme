# Info GainMe

Benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capacity for proactive information seeking using Information Theory as an objective metric.

## About the Paper

This repository implements the framework presented in the paper **"Do Reasoning Models Ask Better Questions? A Formal Information-Theoretic Analysis on Multi-Turn LLM Games"** (AAAI 2026). The work proposes a quantitative methodology to measure Information Gain (IG) of yes/no questions generated by LLMs in a hierarchical knowledge graph environment. The framework is instantiated in the geographical *Guess My City* game and systematically evaluates LLM models with and without Chain-of-Thought reasoning, under fully and partially observable conditions. Results demonstrate that models with explicit reasoning capabilities achieve higher IG per turn and solve tasks in fewer steps.

## Concept

A geographical guessing game where a **Seeker** agent asks strategic questions to an **Oracle** to discover a target city. A **Pruner** reduces the search space after each answer. The main metric is information gain (Δ entropy) per turn.

## Installation

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or `.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

Set the environment variable:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

## Quick Start

### Run full benchmark

```bash
python benchmark_runner.py --config benchmark_config.yaml
```

### Configuration

Edit `benchmark_config.yaml` to configure:
- LLM models (seeker, oracle, pruner)
- Observability mode (`FULLY_OBSERVABLE` or `PARTIALLY_OBSERVABLE`)
- Dataset and number of runs
- Experiment parameters

## Structure

- `src/agents/` - Agents (Seeker, Oracle, Pruner)
- `src/domain/geo/` - Geographical domain and data loading
- `src/analysis/` - Results analysis and metrics
- `outputs/` - Experiment results (CSV, conversations, metrics)

## Metrics

- Shannon entropy over active nodes
- Information gain per turn: `ΔH = H(before) - H(after)`
- Win rate and number of turns until success

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.12
- See `pyproject.toml` for complete dependencies
